# Pymaceuticals, Inc : Matplotlib Challenge 

This challenge involves the utilisation of Pandas and Pyplot to retrieve results from an animal study undertaken by a new pharmaceutical company that specialises in anti-cancer medications, known as Pymaceuticals, Inc.

The dataset comprises raw data that is based on a study of 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors; they received treatment with a range of drug regimens. This experiment occured over the course of 45 days where the tumor development was observed and measured. 

The purpose of this study was to compare the peformance of Capomulin against other drug regimens. 

The tables and figures generated for this task display a top-level summary of the study results, as well as a brief analysis of the results.
